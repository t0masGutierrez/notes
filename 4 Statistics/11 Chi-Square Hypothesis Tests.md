### chi-square goodness of fit hypothesis test
- compare observations with expectations

---
### chi-square goodness of fit hypothesis test assumptions
- categorical response variable with 3 or more categories
- no explanatory variable
- all expected counts greater or equal 5

---
### goodness of fit chi-square-score formula
$$
\begin{aligned}
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{(O_{i}-E_{i})^2}{E_{i}} \\
df = k - 1 \\
E = np_{i} \\
k = \text{number of categories} \\
O = \text{observed counts} \\
E = \text{expected counts} \\
n = \text{sample size} \\
p = \text{proportion}
\end{aligned}
$$

---
### chi-square goodness of fit null hypothesis
- observed proportions equal expected proportions

---
### chi-square goodness of fit null hypothesis formula
$$
\begin{aligned}
H_{0}: (p_{1}, \dots, p_{k}) = (p_{1}, \dots, p_{k})_{0} 
\end{aligned}
$$

---
### chi-square goodness of fit alternative hypothesis
- observed proportions not equal expected proportions

---
### chi-square goodness of fit alternative hypothesis formula
$$
\begin{aligned}
H_{a}: (p_{1}, \dots, p_{k}) \ne (p_{1}, \dots, p_{k})_{0} 
\end{aligned}
$$

---
### chi-square hypothesis test of independence
- compare conditionals with marginals

---
### chi-square hypothesis test of independence assumptions
- categorical response variable
- categorical explanatory variable
- all expected counts greater or equal 5

---
### independence chi-square-score formula
$$
\begin{aligned}
\chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^c \frac{(O_{ij}-E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}} \\
df = (r - 1)(c - 1) \\
E = \frac{rc}{r + c} \\
k = \text{number of categories} \\
O = \text{observed counts} \\
E = \text{expected counts} \\
r = \text{number of rows} \\
c = \text{number of columns} 
\end{aligned}
$$

---
### chi-square independence null hypothesis
- there exists no association between response variable and explanatory variable

---
### chi-square independence null hypothesis formula
$$
\begin{aligned}
H_{0}: \forall i, j \ P(A_{i} \cap B_{j}) = P(A_{i})P(B_{j}) 
\end{aligned}
$$

---
### chi-square independence alternative hypothesis
- there exists association between response variable and explanatory variable

---
### chi-square independence alternative hypothesis formula
$$
\begin{aligned}
H_{a}: \exists i, j \ P(A_{i} \cap B_{j}) \ne P(A_{i})P(B_{j})
\end{aligned}
$$
