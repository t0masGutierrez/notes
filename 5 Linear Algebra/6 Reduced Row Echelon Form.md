### reduced row echelon form
- first nonzero entry of each row equal 1
- first nonzero entry of each successive row equal larger column index
- all entries below first nonzero entry of each row equal 0
- all entries above first nonzero entry of each row equal 0
- rows with all zeros are the final rows of matrix

### gauss-jordan row reduction
- generate augmented matrix
- perform type I row operation on the 1st entry of 1st row such that its 1
- perform type II row operation on all entries below the pivot entry such that its 0
- perform type II row operation on all entries above the pivot entry such that its 0
- if zero pivot entry then perform type III row operation with lower row, if all zeros below zero pivot entry then skip column
- final form of the system equal reduced row echelon form
- back substitute for the particular solution of system of linear equations
